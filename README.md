## What is it?

Psittacus is a lightweight, open-source tool, meant to facilitate
language-learning and teaching, and with a vision to empower teachers and
learners of any written+spoken language around the world.

Psittacus is based on the gamification of the sentence-mining approach, having
an interface vaguely inspired by that of Duolingo and other competing
interactive language learning-tools.

Psittacus aims at democratizing the process of language-learning and teaching,
making it easy for teachers to prepare and collaborate on their own lessons, and
share them in a standardized and easily accessible format.

## Whom does it appeal to?

- Language lovers in general. üåç
- Teachers of any language that need to share quick homeworks/lessons with their
  students. üìö
- Speakers of endangered languages that wish to preserve and spread their native
  tongue. üå± üìº
- Conlangers that want the world to learn their constructed language. ü§ì
- And many more...

## What are some of its main features?

- Simple interface for lang-teachers to prepare lessons.
- Possibility to edit and extend existing lessons.
- Lessons are stored in an easily shareable format.
- Lessons can be taken fully offline, once downloaded/sideloaded.
- Support for audio playback of sentences.
- Support for hover-over-the-word definitions.
- Support for spaced repetition strategies and automatic lesson scheduling.

# Lesson File Format

A 'lesson' comprises: sentence-pairs, word-definitions and audio-data. Each
single lesson is made up of multiple 'propositions'. Each proposition expresses
an idea in two different languages. The information of a lesson is stored in the
widely-known json format, and can be shared as a simple text file.

## The structure of a lesson-json is the following:

[Lesson](./psittacus/app/src/model/formats/LessonData.ts)

## Metadata looks like this:

[Metadata](./psittacus/app/src/model/formats/Metadata.ts)

## Each proposition has the following structure:

[Proposition](./psittacus/app/src/model/formats/PropositionData.ts)

```
/psittacus/dist/index.html
