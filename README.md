## What is it?

Psittacus is a lightweight, open-source tool, meant to facilitate language-learning and teaching, and with a vision to empower teachers and learners of any written+spoken language around the world. 

Psittacus is based on the gamification of the sentence-mining approach, having an interface vaguely inspired by that of Duolingo and other competing interactive language learning-tools. 

Psittacus aims at democratizing the process of language-learning and teaching, making it easy for teachers to prepare and collaborate on their own lessons, and share them in a standardized and easily accessible format. 


## Whom does it appeal to?

* Language lovers in general. üåç
* Teachers of any language that need to share quick homeworks/lessons with their students. üìö
* Speakers of endangered languages that wish to preserve and spread their native tongue. üå± üìº
* Conlangers that want the world to learn their constructed language. ü§ì
* And many more...

## What are some of its main features?
* Simple interface for lang-teachers to prepare lessons.
* Possibility to edit and extend existing lessons.
* Lessons are stored in an easily shareable format. 
* Lessons can be taken fully offline, once downloaded/sideloaded.
* Support for audio playback of sentences.
* Support for hover-over-the-word definitions.
* Support for spaced repetition strategies and automatic lesson scheduling.

   # Lesson File Format
   
  A 'lesson' comprises: sentence-pairs, word-definitions and audio-data. Each single lesson is made up of multiple 'propositions'. 
  Each proposition expresses an idea in two different languages. The information of a lesson is stored in the widely-known json format, 
  and can be shared as a simple text file. 
   
   
  ## The structure of a lesson-json is the following:
  
  ```   
   {   
        "metadata" : {},
        "propositions" : [proposition1, proposition2, proposition3, ...],
        "explanation" : {text : "<h1>some in-depth explanation of the lesson...</h1>"}
   }
  ```

  ## Metadata looks like this:

  ```
  {
    "target_language" : "target lang",
    "source_language" : "source lang",
    "author" : "author-or-authors",
    "title" : "lesson_subject_and_or_number",  
    "last_modified" : 1644144766547
  }
  ```

  (More metadata may get added to lessons in the future).
   
   
  ## The Explanation Part:
   
   Contains 'text', which is an html string of styled text, it can include external resources such as links to other pages or linked multimedia content. It can  serve both as a theoretical introduction to the lesson for the student, or as a container for more insights related to the practical exercises (propositions) in the lesson.


  
  ## Each proposition has the following structure:
  
  ```
  {
   "sentence_one" : "ciao mondo",
   "sentence_two" : "hello world",
   "word_dict" : {"ciao":"hello", "mondo":"world"},
   "reverse_dict" : {"hello":"ciao", "world":"mondo"},
   "audio_base64" : "data:audio/mpeg;base64GkXfo5...",
   "target_to_native" : true
  }
  
  ```
   
   * sentence_one: the sentence in the **target language** (ie: the language the student wishes to learn).
   * sentence_two: the same idea expressed in the **student's language**.
   * audio_base64: the audio of sentence_one (in the **target language**) recorded by a native or proficient speaker. Encoded
   as audio-data in base-64. 
   * target_to_native: true if the user should be asked to translate from the target language to his/her native one, false otherwise.
   * word_dict: a dictionary that provides a brief description of each word of the target lang.
   * reverse_dict: a dictionary that provides a brief description of each word of the source lang in terms of the target lang.
   
   #### Please note that: 
   
   * A 'word' here simply means: 'a string of unicode characters surrounded by spaces'. 
   
   * The definition can and should be made up of more words, and may eventually include a brief analysis of the grammar (tense, gender, case markings...) if that helps the student understand the context better. In more 'advanced' lessons, this brief definition may be provided in
   terms of the target language, for those who favor a full-immersion approach.

<summary><strong>Testing</strong></summary>

# To build this web-app:

(You have to have yarn or npm installed).

## 1. Clone this repo:

... and open up its directory.

## 2. Install the dependencies:

### yarn:

```
yarn install 
```

### npm:

```
npm ci
```

Use **ci** (clean install) instead of `npm i`, to make sure you're building the project with the exact tested dependencies from `package-lock.json`, and not overwriting them.


## 3. Build:

```
yarn run build
```


## 4. Run:

Copy and paste the full path of:

```
/psittacus/dist/index.html
```
... to your browser's navigation bar.


## Debugging:

* Use:

```
yarn run dev-build
```

to generate an un-minified developer build (easier to debug).

And maybe consider doing this in `jsconfig.json`:

```
"checkJs" : true
```

(This option is far too annoying to stay on all the time, and doesn't even catch all of the errors for lack of information).
